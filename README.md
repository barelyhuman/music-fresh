A project based on [fresh](https://github.com/lucacasonato/fresh/) to help the deno team find issue with the current setup.

# User side changes 
-  you'll have to make sure to include extensions to files, or it won't import (ESM specific rules you have to follow)
- you need remember to change the `--watch` flag parameter in the `deno.json` to make sure it watches the newly added folders if you'll be making changes to them
